If you completed the mission the room will be enlighted and wall's become green to indicate your victory.

### Cells

Cells with bulb are count as illuminted.

Walls stop the light's spread

Two cells are neighboured if they are connected by side, so connection by corner doesn't count. (You can't place bulbs on neighboured cells.)

Number on wall says how many bulbs are needed in the neighbour of the wall. (If there are enough bulbs numbered wall gointo be green, else if there are more or less the wall's backround gointo became red.)

### Light Bulbs

Place bulb by clicking on free dark of illuminated cell and click on bulb to remove it.

These light sources emit light both vertical and horizontal directions with infinit range.

Two bulb can not enlight eachother (it's waste of energy), but if they do their place goint to be highlighted with pink background.
