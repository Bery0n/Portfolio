# Light For The King
## Mission from King Noname of Nowhere!

Are you a hero who seeks challenges? Brave adventurers, come and fulfill the impossible! Come serve our royal Majesty, King Noname, Lord of the most adventurous country named Nowhere!

His Majesty wishes to illuminate every corner of his Palace. But His Royal Highness is afraid of spiders, and the corridors are infested with those horrible creatures. Evil never sleeps! Brave adventurers, help us place lamps to banish these monsters!

## Start and Options

Before starting the game, you can choose your adventure **name**, but it **is not a requirement**.

If you accept the mission, the king offers three parts of his castle as places to challenge yourself. Each option contains one puzzle:

- Kitchen (Small)
- Lobby (Medium)
- Dungeons (Large)

During or after your challenge, you can choose between:

- Retry: reset the playground
- Back to the King: change the puzzle
- Run away: abort the challenge and return to the starting page (Buttons are below the puzzle)

## Game Rules

Every room puzzle is made up of cells with the following types:

- Free dark cell (dark grey)
- Illuminated cell (light yellow)
- Cell with a light bulb (icon)
- Wall (black or numbered)

**Finish**

Solve the puzzle by placing light bulbs to illuminate all free dark cells! If you complete the mission, the room will be enlightened, and the walls will turn green to indicate your victory.

**Cells**

- Cells with a bulb are counted as illuminated.
- Walls stop the spread of light.
- Two cells are neighbors if they are connected by a side, so connections by corners don't count. (You can't place bulbs on neighboring cells.)
- The number on the wall indicates how many bulbs are needed in the neighboring cells. (If there are enough bulbs, the numbered wall turns green; otherwise, if there are more or fewer bulbs, the wall's background turns red.)

**Light Bulbs**

- Place a bulb by clicking on a free dark or illuminated cell and then click on the bulb to remove it.
- These light sources emit light in both vertical and horizontal directions with infinite range.
- Two bulbs cannot illuminate each other (it's a waste of energy), but if they do, their place will be highlighted with a pink background.
