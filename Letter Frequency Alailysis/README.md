# LFA

This little program prompts the user for the name of a text file, 
then generates two lists detailing the frequency of each letter found in the file.
- Lists:     
Theranked list is sorted based on the occurrences of the letters, while the ordered list follows alphabetical order.
In both lists, you can find the frequency of each character represented in both the count of occurrences and as a percentage.

- Characters:    
The code can handle hugairan accented letters (á,é,í,ó,ö,ő,ú,ü,ű), but it convert them into english aphabetical characters
(a,e,i,o,u).
