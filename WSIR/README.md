# Why Should I Read?

This project is about to create a responsive and accessible static websites. It is a bunch of solutions for based level frontend developping in HTML, XHTML and CSS.

## Topic
The choice was open to pick topic for the page, so I choose to advertise the positiv affections of reading and created a top 5 recommended book series list. Each series got it's own page to introduce the author(s) and itself. 
Listmembers are the followings:
- Assassin's Creed
- Harry Potter
- Game Of Thrones
- Narnia
- Percy Jackson
  
## Simple Static Website
In this project you can find all bacis elements of a static website. It contains:
- Navigation bar to change between pages and hamburger menus to navigate on them
- Hiperlink, picture and video usage
- Full application form
- Desing by CSS
  
## Responsivity
The website is developed responsivly. There are two layout for different window size, one for laptop screens and one for smaller ones like smar phones. This responsivity is very low level, but works right and may get updated.

## Accessibility
The full designe based on high contrast between text and backroung and bigger font size for good readability.
Each picture and video has a replace text to inform visually impaired users, if they use reading help softwer.
Futhermore on the Harry Potter page below the videos a link shows example for full audio description about the Hufflepuff videa.
