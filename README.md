## Projects
- Letter Frequency Analysator (LFA)
### LFA
This little program prompts the user for the name of a text file, then generates two lists detailing the frequency of each letter found in the file. The ranked list is sorted based on the occurrences of the letters, while the ordered list follows alphabetical order. In both lists, you can find the frequency of each character represented in both the count of occurrences and as a percentage.
